Youtube was a big part of my life when I was growing up as a kid. It was fun wathcing people play videogames that I couldn't afford so I watch their reactions on playing games and was thrill to seeing their gameplay and techniques on how they make their videos/ contnents. So for my first step I started saving money I started buying the necessities on making a let's play channel. Here below were the equipment needed for beginner level.

- Decent Desktop with an i7 processor with 16 GB ram 
- Decent USB microphone (BLue Yeti)
- USB Camera (Logitech 1080p USB Camera)
- Elgato Capture Card
- Sony Vegas Pro
- Audacity

When I first started it was hard trying to get the right audio level to balance the game audio and my commentary audio. For example whenever there was background noises my mic recorded i had to cut that out in the videos so its not a disturbance to the viewrs watching my content. As when I got to my 7th video it gotten easier for my to upload my videos daily. But as college went on I haven't uploaded a vidoe for at least a year due to the work load of school and my part time job. Maybe one day i'll come back and upload more videos when I have the time!
